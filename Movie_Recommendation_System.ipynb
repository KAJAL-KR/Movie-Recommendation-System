        "\n",
        "With thousands of movies released across various genres, users often struggle to find a movie that suits their preferences. The goal of this project is to create a Movie Recommendation System that suggests movies based on a user's preferred genre and desired number of recommendations. The system should store a collection of movies categorized by genres and use basic Python data structures (lists and dictionaries) to provide recommendations. Additionally, users should be able to customize their recommendations, add new movies, and search for specific movies.\n",
